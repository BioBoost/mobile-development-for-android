# Week 2

## Assignment - Activity Lifecycle

Create a new Android application and override at least three lifecycle callbacks. Place a log message inside of each callback.

Some examples are:
```java
Log.v("TAG", "My message");   // Verbose
Log.w("TAG", "My message");   // Warning
Log.e("TAG", "My message");   // Error
Log.d("TAG", "My message");   // Debug
```

You can now create a filter inside Android Studio for the tags.

Try messing around with the app and check when each callback method is called.

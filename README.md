# Mobile Development for Android

Welcome to the course Mobile Development for Android. In this course we learn to create decent working mobile applications for Android phones and tablets. Android apps are typically created using Java as a development language. However support for other languages is emerging. For this course we will be using Java as a main development language.

Most of the material used in this course is created by Nico De Witte. However some paragraphs, definitions, examples, images, ... may be copied from other online sources. In that case a reference can be found in the Sources chapter or as a footnote.
